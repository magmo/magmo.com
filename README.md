### Contributing

To install dependencies:

```shell
yarn
```

To serve the site locally:

```shell
yarn start
```

and visit http://localhost:4200 (as per [ember documentation](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/basic-use/cli-commands/)).

When you are ready, raise a Pull Request into the `master` branch. A deploy preview will be generated automatically by the netlify bot.

magmo.com is currently registered with cloudfare, and hosted on netlify. Pushing to the master branch will result in a fresh deployment of that version.
