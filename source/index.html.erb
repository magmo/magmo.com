          We are a team of researchers working on state channels - the most promising scaling 
          solution for the ethereum blockchain.
        </p>
        <p class="text faded mb-4" align="left">
        The technology exists today to allow a whole class of applications to move the majority of their transactions “off chain”. The complexity of understanding and applying state channel techniques is the main barrier to adoption.
        </p>
        <p class="text faded mb-4" align="left">
        <b>At Magmo, we’re working to make state channels more accessible to the Ethereum developer community.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text faded mb-4" align="left">
        We are fortunate to be supported in this effort by the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum Community Fund.
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded mb-4" align="left">
        Our focus on simplicity and usability led us to develop ForceMove - a simple but powerful state channel framework, suitable for general use. 
        For more details read the <a href="./force-move-games.pdf">paper</a> or
        check out the <a href="https://github.com/magmo/force-move-games">code</a>!
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded mb-4" align="left">
        We have recently launched two games that operate on ForceMove: <a href="https://rps.magmo.com">Rock Paper Scissors</a> and  <a href="https://ttt.magmo.com">Tic Tac Toe</a>. The applications are fully <a href="https://github.com/magmo/apps">open-source</a> and designed to be used as a starting point for developers wanting to integrate state channels into their products.
